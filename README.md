# 🧠 DSA Practice – C++/Java | LeetCode by Topic

Welcome! This repository contains my DSA problem-solving journey using C++/Java, focused on mastering algorithms and data structures for placement preparation.

I'm currently in my 3rd year of Computer Science Engineering and have started solving LeetCode problems seriously from July 2025. This repo helps me stay consistent and organized.
