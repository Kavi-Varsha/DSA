# 🧠 DSA Practice – C++/Java | LeetCode by Topic

Welcome! This repository contains my DSA problem-solving journey using C++/Java, focused on mastering algorithms and data structures for placement preparation.

I'm currently in my 3rd year of Computer Science Engineering and have started solving LeetCode problems seriously from July 2025. This repo helps me stay consistent and organized.

## 🎯 My DSA Goals

- Solve **150+ LeetCode problems** by Jan 2026  
- Master common coding patterns and logic  
- Be interview-ready by the end of 7th semester  
- Build consistency with at least **5 problems/week**
