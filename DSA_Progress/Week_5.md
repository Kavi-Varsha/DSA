📅 Week 5 Progress – Two Pointers (Advanced)
✅ Problems Solved

Two Sum Closest (variation practice)

3Sum

3Sum Closest

4Sum

🧠 Learnings

Learned how sorting + two pointers can reduce brute force complexity from O(n³)/O(n⁴) to O(n²).

Understood how to handle duplicates carefully in 3Sum/4Sum.

Practiced maintaining a variable for closest difference in sum problems.

🔴 Struggles

At first, confused on how to skip duplicates in 3Sum & 4Sum.

Needed clarity on why long long is used in 4Sum to avoid integer overflow.

Initially forgot to update the closest difference properly in 3Sum Closest.
