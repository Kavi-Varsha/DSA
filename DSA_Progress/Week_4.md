ðŸ“… Week 4 Progress â€“ Two Pointers & Sliding Window
âœ… Problems Solved

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Set + Map approaches)

Check Inclusion (Permutation in String)

Find All Anagrams in a String

Character Replacement

Minimum Size Subarray Sum (Sliding Window approach)

Maximum Erasure Value (Maximum Unique Subarray)

Contains Duplicate II (Sliding Window + HashMap)

Fruit Into Baskets

ðŸ§  Learnings

Mastered sliding window pattern: expand right, shrink left when invalid.

Learned when to use unordered_set vs unordered_map.

Got comfortable with problems involving window size conditions and frequency maps.

ðŸ”´ Struggles

Took time to understand Contains Duplicate II (how to store indices & apply sliding window).

Struggled with Happy Number logic earlier, but reviewing hashing helped.

Needed multiple tries to get Check Inclusion / Anagrams in String correct because of handling frequency maps.
