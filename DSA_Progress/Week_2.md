## 🟩 Problems Solved

### 🔹 LeetCode
1. Maximum Average Subarray I (Sliding Window)  
2. Move Zeroes (Two Pointers)  
3. Remove Element (Two Pointers)  
4. Apply Operations to Array (Two Pointers)

## 🟩 Concepts Learned

### 📌 Sliding Window
- Difference between **fixed-size** and **dynamic-size** windows.
- When to shrink/expand the window based on problem conditions.
- Observed that sliding window is reusable across many array problems.

### 📌 Two Pointers
- **Opposite ends** approach for sorted arrays.
- **Same direction** (slow-fast) for in-place updates.
- Applied in problems like **Move Zeroes** and **Remove Element**.

### 📌 STL (C++ Standard Template Library)
- **Vectors**: 
  - `push_back`, `pop_back`, indexing.
  - Replaced static arrays → more flexibility.
- **Unordered Map**:
  - Used for frequency counting and fast lookups.
  - Learned `.find()` vs `.count()` differences.

---

## 🟩 Skills Improved
- Transitioned from raw arrays → **C++ STL** for cleaner code.
- Better debugging: spotted type mismatches & index errors early.
- Built awareness of **patterns** (e.g., move-zeroes logic reused in remove-element).
- Started tracking mistakes → revision-friendly notes.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Still refining clarity on **slow-fast pointers**.  
- Confusion about when to apply hashmaps with sliding window.  
- Tendency to misread problem statements → working on reading carefully first.

## 🚀 Week 2 Takeaway
✅ Planned roadmap problems completed.  
✅ Extra problems + STL practice → progress beyond roadmap.  
🔥 Getting more comfortable with patterns, but need more clarity on dynamic sliding window & hashmap use cases.
